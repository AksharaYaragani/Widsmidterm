Week 1 — Foundations: Data, Mathematics, and First Models
1.1 — Working with Core Python Data Tools

We examined how real-world data workflows are constructed using Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. Through data cleaning, array transformations, and visualization, we developed intuition on converting raw data into meaningful, structured insights—forming the foundation for all subsequent machine learning models.

1.2 — Linear Regression Built from Scratch

Instead of relying on prebuilt libraries, we implemented the entire linear regression pipeline manually. This included feature normalization, cost function derivation, gradient computation, and iterative weight optimization using gradient descent. The model successfully predicted student scores, reinforcing the importance of understanding underlying algorithms rather than simply invoking .fit().

1.3 — Logistic Regression for Decision-Making

We modeled a classification problem by simulating a scientist evaluating rocket propellants. A logistic regression model was developed to determine whether a propellant performed efficiently. This exercise highlighted the differences between regression and classification, focusing on probability estimation, decision boundaries, and model evaluation.

Week 2 — Deep Learning and Modern Computer Vision
2.1 — Image Classification Using Neural Networks

We designed a complete convolutional neural network (CNN) pipeline to classify cartoon characters from images. The workflow included data augmentation, normalization, dataset splitting, and training through convolutional, pooling, and dense layers. Over time, the model transitioned from random predictions to meaningful visual pattern recognition.

2.2 — Object Detection with YOLOv8

Building upon image classification, we advanced to object detection by identifying both what is present in an image and where. Using YOLOv8, we prepared custom datasets, trained and validated models, and fine-tuned parameters such as epochs, batch size, and image resolution. The final system generated accurate bounding-box predictions, marking a shift from theoretical learning to real-world, deployable AI applications.
